https://huggingface.co/spaces/Madhur-01/text-summarizer

Deployed the Text Summarizer WebApp on the Hugging Face Spaces platform using Streamlit and the T5 model. Integrated the PyMuPDF library for handling PDF files seamlessly. Leveraged the power of the T5 small model from Hugging Face to provide accurate and efficient text summarization. Demonstrated proficiency in deploying machine learning models and creating user-friendly applications. Contributed to the advancement of NLP technology by developing an interactive web application for text summarization.

The technologies used in the project include:

1. Python: The programming language used for developing the web application and implementing the machine learning model.

2. Streamlit: The web framework used to create the user interface and provide an interactive experience for users.

3. Hugging Face Transformers: A Python library used for natural language processing tasks, including loading pre-trained models and tokenization.

4. PyMuPDF: A Python library used for handling PDF files and extracting text from them.

5. Hugging Face Spaces: The platform used for deploying the Text Summarizer WebApp, providing hosting and serving capabilities.

6. T5 Model: The T5-small model from Hugging Face, specifically designed for text summarization tasks.
